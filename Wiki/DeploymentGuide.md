# Deployment Steps

## 1. Provisioning TEOC Site

To provision the SharePoint site and lists for the TEOC app, 

* Clone the TEOC [repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-emergency-operations-center.git) locally.
* Open the `Deployment/provisioning` folder to get the latest provisioning files i.e `EOC-Provision.ps1` and `EOC-SiteTemplate.xml`

    ![Provisioning Scripts](./Images/Provisioning_Scripts.png)

>Note: Run below commands with Windows Powershell as Administrator

* Run the below command, this will allow you to run **EOC-Provision.ps1** script. By default, the execution policy is restricted for windows computer. You may change it back to restricted after deployment is completed.
    >Note: Non-windows computer users can skip this as it is unrestricted by default for them.
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```

* Run the below command to unblock the deployment script.
    >Note: File path should be set to provisioning folder. 
    ```
    Unblock-File -Path .\EOC-Provision.ps1
    ```

Below are the steps you need to perform to provision the TEOC site,  

1. Run the PowerShell script as Administrator, script will ask for below inputs,
    
    * XML file path – enter fully qualified path of the XML file (Ex: C:/Scripts/EOC-SiteTemplate.xml) 
    * Tenant Name – Name of the tenant where root TEOC site needs to be provisioned (Ex: Contoso)
    * Tenant Admin Email – Email of tenant admin account (Ex: `abc@contoso.com`) 
    * SharePoint Site Name - Name of the site that needs to be provisioned for TEOC application (Ex: Teams EOC Site)
    >Note: Make a note of the site name _without spaces_ (i.e. The internal name of the site, which is shown in the URL - Ex: /sites/**TeamsEOCSite**), this will be needed later while deploying the resources in Step #3.

    ![Provisioning Scripts](./Images/ProvisioningScript.png)

2. Once the above details are provided, script will check if the “PnP.PowerShell” module is installed, if not, it will install the module.
3. If you are running the **PnP.PowerShell** scripts for the first time for that tenant, it will ask for a list of permissions to be granted. 
    >Note: _PnP.PowerShell_ module requests for all the permissions that are there even if it is not used in the script to ensure smooth running of the scripts. These are delegated permissions, please make sure the user running the script have permissions to perform the action for the script to be executed successfully.

4. Below is the list of permissions it asks,

    ![PnP Permissions](./Images/PnP_Permissions.png)

5. Only SharePoint related permission **Have full control of all site collections** will be utilized in the script so that the site can be provisioned.

6. Please make sure to grant permissions to users who need to use TEOC application, follow the below steps provide permissions,
    -   Navigate to the URL for the TEOC site as the administrator.
    -   If you are using the default configuration, this can be found at _`https://<yourtenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<SiteName>/`_.
        - Select site permissions

            ![SitePermission](./Images/SitePermission.png)

        - Advanced permissions settings

            ![AdvPermission](./Images/AdvPermission.png)

        - Select Grant permissions 

            ![GrantPermission](./Images/GrantPermission.png)

        - Enter in 'Everyone except external users'        

            ![EveryonePermission](./Images/Everyone.png)
        
        >Note: In case access has to be given to specific users, enter specific users instead of directly adding 'Everyone except external users' group.

        - Change permissions to 'TEOC Members [Edit]'
        - Unselect send an email invitation
        - Click share

## 2. Register Azure AD application

You need to first create a new Azure AD Application to secure API permissions. Registering your application establishes a trust relationship between your app and the Microsoft identity platform. 

1. Log in to the Azure Portal using SharePoint Tenant account where you want the app to be installed, and go to the [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) blade.

1. Click **New registration** to create an Azure AD application.
    - **Name**: Name of your Teams App.
    - **Supported account types**: Select "Accounts in single organizational directory"
    - Leave the "Redirect URI" field blank for now.

    ![Azure AD app registration page](./Images/App_Registration_1.png)

1. Click **Register** to complete the registration.
1. When the app is registered, you'll be taken to the app's "Overview" page. Copy the **Application (client) Id and Tenant Id**; we will need it later. 

    ![Azure AD app overview page](./Images/App_Registration_Overview.png)

1. On the side rail in the Manage section, navigate to the "Certificates & secrets" section. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description for the secret, and choose when the secret needs to expire (recommended is 12 months) and click "Add".

1. Once the client secret is created, copy its **Value** only; we will need it later. Once you leave this page, you may not be able to copy it again.

    ![Azure AD app secret](./Images/App_Secret.png)

1. You're done with app registration and client secrets for now. This provides the groundwork for our next steps. Please ensure you have the values ready for Application Id, Tenant Id, Client Secret Value.

## 3. Deploy to your Azure subscription
1. Click on the **Deploy to Azure** button below.

    [![Deploy to Azure](./Images/DeployButton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FOfficeDev%2Fmicrosoft-teams-emergency-operations-center%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Fazuredeploy.json)

1. When prompted, log in to your Azure subscription.

1. Azure will create a "Custom deployment" based on the TEOC ARM template with pre-filled values.

1. Select a subscription and a resource group.
   * We recommend creating a new resource group.
   * The resource group location MUST be in a datacenter that supports the following resources, click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=logic-apps,cognitive-services,search,monitor) to know more about the datacenter and the resources:

     * App Service
     * Application Insights

1. Enter a **Base Resource Name**, which the template uses to generate names for the other resources.
   * The `[Base Resource Name]` must be unique and available. For example, if you select `contosoteoc` as the base name, the name `contosoteoc` must be available (not taken); otherwise, the deployment will fail with a Conflict error.
   * Remember the base resource name that you selected. We will need it later.

   > **Note:** Please ensure that you use lower case and numbers in the field you enter, otherwise the deployment may fail.

1. Update the following fields in the template using the values copied from step 1 & 2 in previous section,
    1. **Client ID**: The application (client) ID of the app registered
    2. **Client Secret**: The client secret Value of the app registered
    3. **Tenant Id**: The tenant Id
    4. **Share Point Site Name**: Name of the SharePoint site that was provisioned in step 1 (It should be the exact site name from the URL Ex: ../sites/**TeamsEOCSite**)

1. Other fields have pre-populated default values, do not change it unless you want it to be customized depending on the need.

    ![Azure App Deploy](./Images/App_Deploy.png)

1. Click on **Review+Create**. Post successful validation clicks on Create. The deployment will take around 30 to 40 Minutes. Please wait for the deployment to be completed and then proceed with the below steps. 

## 4. Set-up Authentication

1. Go to **App Registrations** page [here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) and select the application (TEOC specific) which you created in step 1. Follow the below steps to set up the authentication for the application.

    > Note: For following steps you need to use **appDomain** convention for the app service URL.
    - appDomain is the App service URL without https:// or <<**baseResourceName**>>.azurewebsites.net

1. Under **Manage**, click on **Authentication** to bring up authentication settings.

    1. Click on **Add a Platform**. Select Web and add Redirect URIs in below format:
        - **Redirect URI**: Enter `https://%appDomain%/auth-end.html` for the URL (Ex: `https://<<baseResourceName>>.azurewebsites.net/auth-end.html`)

    1. Click on **Add a Platform**. Select Single-page application and add Redirect URIs in below format:
        - **Redirect URI**: Enter `https://%appDomain%/auth-end.html?clientId= %clientId%` for the URL (Ex: `https://<<baseResourceName>>.azurewebsites.net/auth-end.html?clientId=<<Client Id>>`)
        - Click on Add URI and add another entry as, `https://%appDomain%/blank-auth-end.html` (Ex: `https://<<baseResourceName>>.azurewebsites.net/blank-auth-end.html`)     

    1. Click **Save** to commit your changes.

        ![Azure Authentication](./Images/Setup_Authentication.png)

    1. Back under **Manage**, click on **Expose an API**.

    1. Click on the **Set** link next to **Application ID URI**, and change the value to `api://%appDomain%/%clientId%` (Ex: `api://<<baseResourceName>>.azurewebsites.net/<<Client Id>>`.

    1. Click **Save** to commit your changes.

    1. Click on **Add a scope**, under **Scopes defined by this API**. In the flyout that appears, enter the following values:
        * **Scope name:** access_as_user 
        > Note: Enter Scope name as _access_as_user_, otherwise it may throw 403 forbidden error while logging in to the app
        * **Who can consent?:** Admins and users
        * **Admin consent display name:** Teams can access app’s web APIs
        * **Admin consent description:**  Allows Teams to call the app’s web APIs as the current user.

    1. Click **Add scope** to commit your changes.

        ![API Add Scope](./Images/Add_Scope.png)

    1. Click **Add a client application**, under **Authorized client applications**. In the flyout that appears, enter the following values:
        * **Client ID**: `5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346` (_Teams WebApp Client Id_)
        > Note: This Id is different than the Client Id from step 2 
        * **Authorized scopes**: Select the scope that ends with `access_as_user`. (There should only be 1 scope in this list.)

    1. Click **Add application** to commit your changes.

    1. **Repeat the previous two steps**, but with below Ids.
        * 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 (_Teams Mobile or Desktop App Client Id_)
        * 4345a7b9-9a63-4910-a426-35363201d503 (_Office WebApp Client Id1_)
        * 4765445b-32c6-49b0-83e6-1d93765276ca (_Office WebApp Client Id2_)
        * d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c (_Outlook Desktop App Client Id_)
        * 00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000 (_Outlook Web App Client Id_)

    1. After this step you should have **6** client applications listed under **Authorized client applications**.

        ![Authorized Apps](./Images/Authorized_Client_Apps.png)

1. Back under **Manage**, click on **Manifest**.
    1. In the editor that appears, find `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` and update the value from **null** to **2**
    2. Find the `optionalClaims` property in the JSON Azure AD application manifest, and replace it with the following block:
    ```
        "optionalClaims": {
            "idToken": [],
            "accessToken": [
                {
                    "name": "idtyp",
                    "source": null,
                    "essential": false,
                    "additionalProperties": []
                }
            ],
            "saml2Token": []
        },
    ```    
    3. Click **Save** to commit your changes.

        ![Optional Claims](./Images/Manifest_Optional_Claims.png)

## 5. Add Permissions to Microsoft Graph Azure AD app

In this section, you’ll be adding the necessary Graph API permissions to the application. 

1. Select **API Permissions** blade from the left hand side.

2. Click on **Add a permission** button to add permission to your app.

3. In the fly out, click **Microsoft Graph**, then select **Delegated permissions** and enter the following permissions one by one,

    *  Directory.AccessAsUser.All
    *  Group.ReadWrite.All
    *  People.Read
    *  Sites.Manage.All
    *  TeamMember.ReadWrite.All 
    *  TeamsTab.Create
    *  TeamworkTag.ReadWrite
    *  User.Read
    *  User.ReadBasic.All

4. Click on **Add Permissions** to commit your changes. 
5. Below is the description/reason for each permission granted above, 

    1.  **Directory.AccessAsUser.All** : Allows the app to have the same access to information in the directory as the signed-in user. TEOC app uses this permission to access the Teams, SharePoint and Users information in the app. 
    2.  **Group.ReadWrite.All** : Allows the app to create groups, read and update group memberships, and delete groups. Also allows the app to read and write calendars, conversations, files, and other group content for all groups. All these operations can be performed by the app without a signed-in user. TEOC app uses this permission to create a group when the incident is created.
    3.  **People.Read** : Allows the app to read a scored list of people relevant to the signed-in user. The list can include local contacts, contacts from social networking or your organization's directory, and people from recent communications (such as email and Skype). TEOC app uses this permission for the “People Picker” fields to work (for ex. - Incident Commander and Role assigned user). 
    4.  **Sites.Manage.All** : Allows the app to manage and create lists, documents, and list items in all site collections on behalf of the signed-in user. TEOC app uses this permission to create the lists in the site created for each incident.
    5.  **TeamMember.ReadWrite.All** : Add and remove members from teams, on behalf of the signed-in user. Also allows changing a member's role, for example from owner to non-owner. TEOC app uses this permission to update the Teams membership when updating a role. 
    6.  **TeamsTab.Create** : Allows the app to create tabs in any team in Microsoft Teams, on behalf of the signed-in user. This does not grant the ability to read, modify or delete tabs after they are created, or give access to the content inside the tabs. TEOC app uses to create the tabs in the team created for the incident. 
    7.  **TeamworkTag.ReadWrite** :  Allows the app to read and write tags in Teams without a signed-in user. TEOC app uses this permission to create and update the tags which gets created along with the incident. 
    8.  **User.Read** : Allows users to sign-in to the app and allows the app to read the profile of signed-in users. It also allows the app to read basic company information of signed-in users. TEOC app uses to get the current user details in the app. 
    9.  **User.ReadBasic.All** : Allows the app to read a basic set of profile properties of other users in your organization on behalf of the signed-in user. TEOC app uses this permission search for other users and assign them roles while creating the incident.

5. Reach out to your IT admin team to grant consent for the permissions provided. If you’re an admin, click on Grant the admin Consent for ******* 

    ![API Permissions](./Images/Api_Permissions.png)

## 6. Create the Teams app packages

Now we build the teams package to upload the TEOC (Teams Emergency Operations Center) app to the Teams client. TEOC in turn will connect to the SharePoint resources/list to the Tenant deployed. 

To create the team's package, 

1. Make sure you have cloned the app [repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-emergency-operations-center.git) locally.

1. Open the `Deployment\appPackage\manifest.json` file in a text editor.
    
1. Change the `<<appDomain>>` placeholder in the below setting to your app domain URL, for example    
        
    * `"configurationUrl": "https://<<appDomain>>/index.html#/config"`
    * `"contentUrl": "https://<<appDomain>>/index.html#/tab"`
    * `"websiteUrl": "https://<<appDomain>>/index.html#/tab"`

    ![Manifest Updates](./Images/Manifest_Placeholders.png)

1. Update the validDomains and webApplicationInfo details.

    * Change the `<<clientId>>` placeholder in the webApplicationInfo setting with the _%clientId%_. This is the application id which we copied in step 2.

    * Change the `<<appDomain>>` placeholder in the _webApplicationInfo_ and _validDomains_ to the `%appDomain%` value.  

    ```
      "validDomains": [ 
            "<<appDomain>>" 
        ], 
    ```
    ```
        "webApplicationInfo": { 
            "id": "<<clientId>>", 
            "resource": "api://<<appDomain>>/<<clientId>>" 
        } 
     ```

    ![Manifest Updates](./Images/Manifest_Placeholders_2.png)

1. Create a ZIP package with the manifest.json and resources folder with color.png, and outline.png. The two image files are the icons for your app in Teams.

    * Name this package `teoc.zip`, so you know that this is the app for the TEOC teams. 

    * Make sure that the files are the top level of the ZIP package, with no nested folders. 
    
    ![Zip Folder Structure](./Images/Zip_Folder_Structure.png)

  
## 7. Install the app in Microsoft Teams

1. Upload the app (the teoc.zip package) to Teams. 

1. If your tenant has sideloading apps enabled, you can install your app by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/apps/apps-upload#load-your-package-into-teams) 

1. You can also upload it to your tenant's app catalog so that it can be available for everyone in your tenant to install. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/tenant-apps-catalog-teams) 

    > Note: Please review [app permission policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-app-permission-policies) to allow access to the app

## 8. Deploy “NotifyToTeams” Extension in SharePoint

1. To get the latest package for extension, make sure you have cloned the app [repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-emergency-operations-center.git) locally.  

1. Get the latest package file `“eoc-extension.sppkg”` under **EOC-Extensions/sharepoint/ solution** folder.  

    ![Extension Package](./Images/Extension_Package.png)

1. Below are the steps you need to perform to add **NotifyToTeams** extension in TEOC site.
