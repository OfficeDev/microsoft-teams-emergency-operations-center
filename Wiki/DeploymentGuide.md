# Prerequisites

To begin deployment for Microsoft Teams Emergency Operations Center (TEOC) application, you will need: 
* An Azure subscription where you can create the following kinds of resources:
    * App Service
    * App Service Plan
    * Application Insights
    * App Registration

* You need at least contributor access to the Azure subscription to perform the deployment.

* To run the TEOC Provision PnP PowerShell script, you'll need PowerShell version 7.x or newer. This version is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac, and you can download it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4).

* If you have previously installed PnP PowerShell, ensure your version is 2.12.0 or newer. Here's the command to verify the version of PnP PowerShell you're currently using.
    ```
    get-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell -ListAvailable | select-Object -Property Name, Version, Path
    ```

# Deployment Steps

## 1. Provisioning TEOC Site

### Azure App Registration for PnP PowerShell

* Open a new PowerShell console (7.x) as an administrator (right-click, Run As Administrator). Ensure unrestricted execution policy with the following:
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```
* Ensure the PnP.PowerShell module is loaded with the following:
    ```
    Import-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell
    ```
    If you have multiple versions of PnP.PowerShell installed, target a latest version with the -RequiredVersion flag.

* Run the following script ONCE per tenant to create an Azure App Registration for PnP:

    Log in with user credentials that have the Global Administrator role.
If you have previously registered PnP.PowerShell, check the App Registration in the Azure portal and make sure it has delegated permissions for AllSites.FullControl and User.Read.All. Also make sure that you've granted consent as an Administrator.
    > Note: Replace '[Your App Name]' with your app name and '[Tenant]' with your tenant name.
    ```
    Register-PnPEntraIDAppForInteractiveLogin -ApplicationName "[Your App Name]" -Tenant [Tenant].onmicrosoft.com -Interactive
    ```
    Please check the [Register an Entra ID Application to use with PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/registerapplication.html#automatically-create-an-app-registration-for-interactive-login) guide to setup Entra Id, if you face any issues in running the above command.

* Provide consent on behalf of your organization

    ![Provisioning Scripts](./Images/PnPEntraIdAppConsent.png)

* Make a note of the **AzureAppId/ClientId** GUID returned from above step as it will be needed in the below step to provision the SharePoint site. This is the **ClientId** of the new PnP PowerShell Azure App Registration.

    ![PnPEntraIdAppRegistrationCompletion](./Images/PnPEntraIdAppRegistrationCompletion.png)

### Run the PnP Provisioning script
To provision the SharePoint site and lists for the TEOC app, 

* Clone the TEOC [repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-emergency-operations-center.git) locally.
* Open the `Deployment/provisioning` folder to get the latest provisioning files i.e `EOC-Provision.ps1` and `EOC-SiteTemplate.xml`

    ![Provisioning Scripts](./Images/Provisioning_Scripts.png)

    > Note: Run below commands with Windows Powershell as Administrator

* Run the command below to allow the execution of the **EOC-Provision.ps1** script. By default, the execution policy is restricted for Windows computers. You may change it back to restricted after deployment is completed.

    > Note: Non-windows computer users can skip this as it is unrestricted by default for them.
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```

* Run the below command to unblock the deployment script.
    >Note: File path should be set to provisioning folder. 
    ```
    Unblock-File -Path .\EOC-Provision.ps1
    ```

Below are the steps you need to perform to provision the TEOC site,  

1. Run the PowerShell script as Administrator. The script will ask for the following inputs:
    
    * XML file path – enter fully qualified path of the XML file (Ex: C:/Scripts/EOC-SiteTemplate.xml) 
    * Tenant Name – Name of the tenant where root TEOC site needs to be provisioned (Ex: Contoso)
    * Tenant Admin Email – Email of tenant admin account (Ex: `abc@contoso.com`) 
    * SharePoint Site Name - Name of the site that needs to be provisioned for TEOC application (Ex: Teams EOC Site)
    * AzureAppId/Client Id - Enter the App Id which you registered for Interactive login.
        > **Note:** Make a note of the site name _without spaces_ (i.e., the internal name of the site, which is shown in the URL - Ex: **TeamsEOCSite**). This will be needed later while deploying the resources in Step #3.

    ![Provisioning Scripts](./Images/ProvisioningScript.png)

2. Once the above details are provided, script will check if the “PnP.PowerShell” module is installed, if not, it will install the module.
3. If you are running the **PnP.PowerShell** scripts for the first time for that tenant, it will ask for a list of permissions to be granted. 
    > Note: The PnP.PowerShell module requests all permissions, even if they are not used in the script, to ensure smooth running of the scripts. These are delegated permissions, please make sure the user running the script has permissions to perform the action for the script to be executed successfully.

4. Below is the list of permissions it asks,

    ![PnP Permissions](./Images/PnP_Permissions.png)

5. Only SharePoint related permission **Have full control of all site collections** will be utilized in the script so that the site can be provisioned.

6. Please make sure to grant permissions to users who need to use TEOC application, follow the below steps provide permissions,
    -   Navigate to the URL for the TEOC site as the administrator.
    -   If you are using the default configuration, this can be found at _`https://<yourtenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<SiteName>/`_.
        - Select site permissions

            ![SitePermission](./Images/SitePermission.png)

        - Advanced permissions settings

            ![AdvPermission](./Images/AdvPermission.png)

        - Select Grant permissions 

            ![GrantPermission](./Images/GrantPermission.png)

        - Enter in 'Everyone except external users'        

            ![EveryonePermission](./Images/Everyone.png)
        
        > Note: In case access has to be given to specific users, enter specific users instead of directly adding 'Everyone except external users' group.

        - Change permissions to 'TEOC Members [Edit]'
        - Unselect send an email invitation
        - Click share

## 2. Register Azure AD application

You need to first create a new Azure AD Application to secure API permissions. Registering your application establishes a trust relationship between your app and the Microsoft identity platform. 

1. Log in to the Azure Portal using SharePoint Tenant account where you want the app to be installed, and go to the [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) blade.

1. Click **New registration** to create an Azure AD application.
    - **Name**: Name of your Teams App.
    - **Supported account types**: Select "Accounts in single organizational directory"
    - Leave the "Redirect URI" field blank for now.

    ![Azure AD app registration page](./Images/App_Registration_1.png)

1. Click **Register** to complete the registration.
1. When the app is registered, you'll be taken to the app's "Overview" page. Copy the **Application (client) Id and Tenant Id**; we will need it later. 

    ![Azure AD app overview page](./Images/App_Registration_Overview.png)

1. On the side rail in the Manage section, navigate to the "Certificates & secrets" section. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description for the secret, and choose when the secret needs to expire (recommended is 12 months) and click "Add".

1. Once the client secret is created, copy its **Value** only; we will need it later. Once you leave this page, you may not be able to copy it again.

    ![Azure AD app secret](./Images/App_Secret.png)

1. You're done with app registration and client secrets for now. This provides the groundwork for our next steps. Please ensure you have the values ready for Application Id, Tenant Id, Client Secret Value.

## 3. Deploy to your Azure subscription
1. Click on the **Deploy to Azure** button below.

    [![Deploy to Azure](./Images/DeployButton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FOfficeDev%2Fmicrosoft-teams-emergency-operations-center%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Fazuredeploy.json)

1. When prompted, log in to your Azure subscription.

1. Azure will create a "Custom deployment" based on the TEOC ARM template with pre-filled values.

1. Select a subscription and a resource group.
   * We recommend creating a new resource group.
   * The resource group location MUST be in a datacenter that supports the following resources, click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=logic-apps,cognitive-services,search,monitor) to know more about the datacenter and the resources:

     * App Service
     * Application Insights

1. Enter a **Base Resource Name**, which the template uses to generate names for the other resources.
   * The `[Base Resource Name]` must be unique and available. For example, if you select `contosoteoc` as the base name, the name `contosoteoc` must be available (not taken); otherwise, the deployment will fail with a Conflict error.
   * Remember the base resource name that you selected. We will need it later.

> **Note:** Ensure that you use lowercase letters and numbers in the field you enter; otherwise, the deployment may fail.

1. Update the following fields in the template using the values copied from step 1 & 2 in previous section,
    1. **Client ID**: The application (client) ID of the app registered mentioned in step 2
    2. **Client Secret**: The client secret Value of the app registered
    3. **Tenant Id**: The tenant Id
    4. **Share Point Site Name**: Name of the SharePoint site that was provisioned in step 1
       > Note: Add just the site name and not the entire URL. For example, if the URL of your sharepoint site is 'https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/TEOCSite' add just "TEOCSite"

1. Other fields have pre-populated default values, do not change it unless you want it to be customized depending on the need.

    ![Azure App Deploy](./Images/App_Deploy.png)

1. Click on **Review+Create**. Post successful validation clicks on Create. The deployment will take around 30 to 40 Minutes. Please wait for the deployment to be completed and then proceed with the below steps. 

## 4. Set-up Authentication

1. Go to **App Registrations** page [here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) and select the application (TEOC specific) which you created in step 2. Follow the below steps to set up the authentication for the application.

    > Note: For the following steps, you need to use the **appDomain** convention for the app service URL.
    - appDomain is the App service URL without https:// or <<**baseResourceName**>>.azurewebsites.net

1. Under **Manage**, click on **Authentication** to bring up authentication settings.

    1. Click on **Add a Platform**. Select Web and add Redirect URIs in below format:
        - **Redirect URI**: Enter `https://%appDomain%/auth-end.html` for the URL (Ex: `https://<<baseResourceName>>.azurewebsites.net/auth-end.html`)

    1. Click on **Add a Platform**. Select Single-page application and add Redirect URIs in below format:
        - **Redirect URI**: Enter `https://%appDomain%/auth-end.html?clientId= %clientId%` for the URL (Ex: `https://<<baseResourceName>>.azurewebsites.net/auth-end.html?clientId=<<Client Id>>`)
        - Click on Add URI and add another entry as, `https://%appDomain%/blank-auth-end.html` (Ex: `https://<<baseResourceName>>.azurewebsites.net/blank-auth-end.html`)     

    1. Click **Save** to commit your changes.

        ![Azure Authentication](./Images/Setup_Authentication.png)

    1. Back under **Manage**, click on **Expose an API**.

    1. Click on the **Set** link next to **Application ID URI**, and change the value to `api://%appDomain%/%clientId%` (Ex: `api://<<baseResourceName>>.azurewebsites.net/<<Client Id>>`.

    1. Click **Save** to commit your changes.

    1. Click on **Add a scope**, under **Scopes defined by this API**. In the flyout that appears, enter the following values:
        * **Scope name:** access_as_user 
        > Note: Enter the scope name as _access_as_user_; otherwise, it may throw a 403 forbidden error while logging in to the app.
        * **Who can consent?:** Admins and users
        * **Admin consent display name:** Teams can access app’s web APIs
        * **Admin consent description:**  Allows Teams to call the app’s web APIs as the current user.

    1. Click **Add scope** to commit your changes.

        ![API Add Scope](./Images/Add_Scope.png)

    1. Click **Add a client application**, under **Authorized client applications**. In the flyout that appears, enter the following values:
        * **Client ID**: `5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346` (_Teams WebApp Client Id_)
        > Note: This Id is different from the **Client Id** from step 2 
        * **Authorized scopes**: Select the scope that ends with `access_as_user`. (There should only be 1 scope in this list.)

    1. Click **Add application** to commit your changes.

    1. **Repeat the previous two steps**, but with below Ids.
        * 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 (_Teams Mobile or Desktop App Client Id_)

## 7. Create the Teams app packages

Now we build the teams package to upload the TEOC (Teams Emergency Operations Center) app to the Teams client. TEOC in turn will connect to the SharePoint resources/list to the Tenant deployed. 

To create the team's package, 

1. Make sure you have cloned the app [repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-emergency-operations-center.git) locally.

1. Open the `Deployment\appPackage\manifest.json` file in a text editor.
    
1. Change the `<<appDomain>>` placeholder in the below settings to your app domain URL, for example    
        
    * `"configurationUrl": "https://<<appDomain>>/index.html#/config"`
    * `"contentUrl": "https://<<appDomain>>/index.html#/tab"`
  

1. Change the `<<websiteUrl>>` placeholder in the setting below to the URL of the TEOC SharePoint site

    * `"websiteUrl": "https://<<websiteUrl>>"`


    ![Manifest Updates](./Images/Manifest_Placeholders.png)

1. Update the validDomains and webApplicationInfo details.

    * Change the `<<clientId>>` placeholder in the webApplicationInfo setting to the _%clientId%_. This is the application id we copied in step 2.

    * Change the `<<appDomain>>` placeholder in the _webApplicationInfo_ and _validDomains_ to the `%appDomain%` value.  
    > Note: appDomain is the App service URL without https:// or <<**baseResourceName**>>.azurewebsites.net

    ```
      "validDomains": [ 
            "<<appDomain>>" 
        ], 
    ```
    ```
        "webApplicationInfo": { 
            "id": "<<clientId>>", 
            "resource": "api://<<appDomain>>/<<clientId>>" 
        } 
     ```

    ![Manifest Updates](./Images/Manifest_Placeholders_2.png)

1. Create a ZIP package with the manifest.json and resources folder with color.png, and outline.png. The two image files are the icons for your app in Teams.

    * Name this package `teoc.zip`, so you know that this is the app for the TEOC teams. 

    * Make sure that the files are the top level of the ZIP package, with no nested folders. 
    
    ![Zip Folder Structure](./Images/Zip_Folder_Structure.png)

  
## 8. Install the app in Microsoft Teams

1. Upload the app (the teoc.zip package) to Teams. 

1. If your tenant has sideloading apps enabled, you can install your app by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/apps/apps-upload#load-your-package-into-teams) 

1. You can also upload it to your tenant's app catalog so that it can be available for everyone in your tenant to install. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/tenant-apps-catalog-teams) 

    > Note: Please review [app permission policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-app-permission-policies) to allow access to the app

## 9. Verify M365 group creation policy in Azure Portal

1. Log in to the Azure Portal in the tenant where the TEOC app registration is done.

2. Navigate to Groups, check for the setting "Users can create Microsoft 365 groups in Azure portals, API or PowerShell".

    ![Azure Settings](./Images/M365GroupPolicy.png)

3. If it is set to **No**, then follow this [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/manage-creation-of-groups?view=o365-worldwide) to create a M365 group that can be used to control who is able to create Microsoft 365 Groups in the tenant and add the users from your organization who will be creating incidents in the TEOC application to that M365 group.

4. If it is set to **Yes**, no action is required.
