# How to use this Teams Tab app TEOC app

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context. Please be advised that mgt-teamsfx-provider library in this app is currently in preview stage, please expect breaking changes in the future release.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version after 4.0.0 or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Debug

- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code. 
- Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button.
- From TeamsFx CLI: Start debugging the project by executing the command `teamsfx preview --local` in your project directory.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams app manifest in `templates/appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:
* `manifest.template.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).

This file contains template arguments with `{...}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.

## Add Single Sign On feature

Microsoft Teams provides a mechanism by which an application can obtain the signed-in Teams user token to access Microsoft Graph (and other APIs). Teams Toolkit facilitates this interaction by abstracting some of the Azure Active Directory (AAD) flows and integrations behind some simple, high-level APIs. This enables you to add single sign-on (SSO) features easily to your Teams application.

Please follow this [document](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-add-sso) to add single sign on for your project.
